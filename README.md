# Complexity of Quality 

## Starter projects

These are the starter projects for complexity over quality hackday fun senario. Pick one and make it "better" in some way :) 

* [Date Profile Creator](https://github.com/NPDeehan/Date-Profile-Creator-Example)
  This is a process that helps you generate a good dating profile. It uses BPMN and Camunda 8 as a framework and serves as an example of integrations of ChatGPT and webhooks.
* [Birthday Invite](https://github.com/NPDeehan/Birthday-Invite-Example)
  A birthday invite process! Using Camunda and BPMN, this example shows how to integrate with Slack and SendGrid to send messages, with a little bonus of using multi-instance markers to send multiple emails.
* [Invoice Process](https://github.com/NPDeehan/Invoice-Kafka-Process-Example)
  This is a simple enough example project for Camunda 8 which shows how you can process an invoice between end users and then at the end send and receive Kafka messages.
